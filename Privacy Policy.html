            <h6 id="dontTrack">Do Not Track</h6>
            <p>Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or
                “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’
                visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. iamalive.store does not currently
                commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Company’s Web sites, in part, because
                no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or
                regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. iamalive.store takes privacy
                and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT
                browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A.<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
                    </li>
                    <li>B. <strong>Request correction</strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
                    <li>C.<strong> Request deletion</strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                    <li>D.<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                    <li>E.<strong>Request restriction</strong>of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</li>

                        <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                        <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
                        <li>You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>

                    <li>G.<strong>Withdraw consent</strong>at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you.</li>
