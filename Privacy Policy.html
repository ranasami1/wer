            <h6>Do Not Track</h6>
            <p>Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or
                “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’
                visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. iamalive.store does not currently
                commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Company’s Web sites, in part, because
                no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or
                regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. iamalive.store takes privacy
                and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT
                browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>

                </p>
                <p>When we share your personal information with a third party, we require that third party to protect the information consistent with this Statement and limit its use of the information to performing the services they provide to us.

                <ol>
                    <li>A.<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
